        ## Escape Analysis

        For the sake of expediting this request, the details below can be completed at a later time should you so choose.
        However, the Escape Analysis section is **required** for any accepted Code Freeze Exception.

        In this section:

        * Think about how the bug escaped your team.
        * Write down ideas on how you could prevent this bug â€“ for example, by writing automated tests, creating a new process, or updating documentation.
        * Make a plan with your team to implement the changes proposed above in order to catch the bug earlier next time and add the related tasks to your backlog.
        * Please, add a separate comment that includes the details for the Escape Analysis. Together with this Escape Analysis, please make sure to include an actionable item that covers the gap exposed by this analysis. It could be a GitHub issue, the reference of a new item to discuss in a team meeting, etc. Anything that prevents this analysis from getting lost in P2 will be useful.
